title: The Past, Present and Future

## The Past

Blogging hasnâ€™t been kind to me. All of the 20 people who read my blog gave up on me when I stopped posting about a decade ago. My old writing sounded condescending with a hint of ego. I didn't mean to sound that way, I was just trying to help.

In my mind I was always writing and rewriting my views of the world. I spent a lot of time picking themes and building blogging platforms. I'm older and tired now. So I will write and ignore the details of the medium for now.

## Present

Locked down like everyone else, I am just hoping and counting the days to see the end of this pandemic. These days I'm listening more and trying to sound less condescending and reflecting on better days gone by.

From the dot com crash of 2000, the housing crash of 2008 and now the pandemic of 2020 the good times seem to have a predictable expiry date.

## and Future

This is the hard part. No one really knows where we go from here. Whatever the future looks like I can bet you everyone is making plans. These plans will shape the future world we live in.

When we have a cure we might see a sea of change or we go back to business as usual. Whatever your plans are make sure they are inclusive, clear and kind.
