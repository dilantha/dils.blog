[Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) is a good book. James has done a lot of research and outlines multiple ways to build good habits while getting rid of bad ones. He tells stories from his life and others and lays out the science behind it.

This book is worth keeping around and rereading to keep you on track.

I would highly recommend [reading up on his blog](https://jamesclear.com/articles) about habits as well.
