title: Time Off

Well hello. I'm recovering from burnout this weekend. I had to take a couple of days off to recharge. I love what I do but during this pandemic I forget to pace things out sometimes.

I miss those long weekends in Sri Lanka. Those kept me more balanced and out of techie rabbit holes.

This reminded me of an old video I saw of John Cleese talking about creativity and how we need space and time between work for creativity to happen.

I couldn't find that exact video but this one is pretty close to the idea.
